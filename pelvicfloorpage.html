                        <p class="anatomy-description"> The pelvic floor muscles refers to a group of muscles that are located at the bas of the pelvis. The pelvic floor's main roles include supporting the bladder, bowel, and reproductive organs, and have a role in supporting your spine and the pressure that is created within the abdomen.
                        </p>
                        <p class="how-to-contract"> To contract your pelvic floor muscles, set yourself into a comfortable sitting or lying down position and close your eyes. Try and think of each of these cues below and stick with the cue that works best for you:
                            <ul class="cue-list">
                                <li>think about the movement of stopping your urine mid-stream</li>
                                <li>this time, think about trying to stop wind from coming out</li>
                                <li>for vulva owners: try and think about thinking of picking up a silk scarf with the vagina, and lift the silk scarf in side</li>
                                <li>for penis owners: think about the sensation of stepping into cold water, and you are trying to draw your testes up and away from the water</li>
                            </ul>
                        It is important to note, the rest of your body should be relaxed while completing your pelvic floor contraction. If someone was watching you complete your contraction, your body should be in complete stillness. If you are still unsure, ask your physiotherapist to check your technique.
